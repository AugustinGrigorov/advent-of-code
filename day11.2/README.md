## --- Part Two ---

You're not sure what it's trying to paint, but it's definitely not a _registration identifier_. The Space Police are getting impatient.

Checking your external ship cameras again, you notice a white panel marked "emergency hull painting robot starting panel". The rest of the panels are _still black_, but it looks like the robot was expecting to _start on a white panel_, not a black one.

Based on the <span title="Just be glad it wasn't a full set of Space Law Space Books; the number of pages is *astronomical*.">Space Law Space Brochure</span> that the Space Police attached to one of your windows, a valid registration identifier is always _eight capital letters_. After starting the robot on a single _white panel_ instead, _what registration identifier does it paint_ on your hull?
